This year I intend to get a better grasp on C++

Input folders are ignored to comply with the AOC TOC.

## How to run, note to self

With MSVC:
~~- Install MSVC compiler files for VS 2022 (check VSCode C++ extension documentation https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)~~
~~- Run Developer PowerShell for VS 2022~~
~~- Navigate to repo folder~~
~~- launch VSCode~~
This was unreliable at best.

Use MSys instead:
- Winget install msys2.msys2
- Add msys2 to windows terminal (if I want, or just run MSYS2 UCRT64)
- Add mingw based on the pacman line in the documentation. https://www.msys2.org
